			<h2>How did you define your audience and tone?</h2>
				<p>My audience will consist of my previous employers, clients, and colleagues as well as prospective clients, industry enthusiasts, and professionals (e.g., graphic designers, creative directors, and developers).</p>
				<p>I wanted the tone to be professional, but casual.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="questionTwo">
			<h2>What existing websites out there were you most inspired by?</h2>
				<p>For this project, I was most inspired by <a href="http://www.alistairlane.com/" target="_blank">http://www.alistairlane.com/</a>. A lot of websites look similar these days with the templates available. I found his site to be interesting. I like the way he presented his content and that the site doesn’t have the standard navigation menu on the top of the page. The site is clean, minimalist, and has a monochromatic color palette.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="questionThree">
			<h2>What parts of your design are you most proud of?</h2>
				<p>I’m most proud of the scrolling speed and my “back to top” button. It fades in as you scroll down the page then fades out as you scroll up the page.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="questionFour">
			<h2>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h2>
				<p>I like clean and minimalist design, which sometimes can feel too cold and too formal. So my challenge is to find the right combo to maintain a professional look while being more casual. Exploring with fonts, colors, and layouts. To be continued…</p>
		</section>

		<section id="questionFive">
			<h2>What parts of the development process did you overcome?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p>Some of the effects for the site were written with jQuery, a language that I haven’t learned or used before.</p> 
					</li>

					<li>
					<p>I also added a favicon image that had to be saved under the .ico format. I didn’t realize at first that I had to download a plugin to Photoshop to get that option.</p> 
					</li>

					<li>
					<p>The following tags were not working: "em" and "strong." I was sure of their meaning ("em" being italic, and "strong" being bold, by default) but they were not changing the style of the font until I defined them in css. I guess the values were cancelled with the “reset.css” file.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="questionSix">
			<h2>What struggles did you encounter when developing the page?</h2>
				<p>The navigation and footer don't look as they should on Safari.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="questionSeven">
			<h2>What did you learn from working through this mid-term project?</h2>
				<p>Detach yourself from what you like and your initial concept. You might be drawn to a font, a color, or a layout, but does it work for the specific project that you’re working on? Detach yourself from it, move on, and be flexible.</p>
				<p>Each element must have a reason behind it.</p>
