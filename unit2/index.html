<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a lifestyle contributor writing about food and wellbeing, living in Brooklyn, New York. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I have enjoyed changing the code of Tumblr themes, but I want to learn how to code correctly for personal projects as well as expand my skill set.</p>
<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a freelance web designer or even take the plunge as a junior front-end web developer with digital agencies because I would like to work in a creative environment where I can grow.</p>
<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifestyle contributor</strong>, Freelance<br><em>New York, 2014 - present</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>
